   <h1> 
      <center>The KLEAN company</center> 
    </h1>

      <p>
        We are KLEAN. A company based in Norway, founded by two former students at OsloMet. 
        The company was founded in Oslo in 2020 and started out as a school project. 
        The two students, Markus Høgvard and Christian Bertelsen had an assignment about coming 
        up with 30 ideas for one of UN’s sustainable development goals. 
        We chose goal nr. 6: clean water and sanitation.      
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The ideas varied very, but one of them, a filtration system stuck with us. 
        This is where KLEAN came in. After a couple of months, we realized that this was 
        something we wanted to do, for real. And so, we began our research. 
        We had to find out if this even was possible. To our surprise and relief, it was.
        But first we had to make a company. Markus had already some previous knowledge of establishing a company,
        so after about three months, KLEAN Co. was founded. 
        After a couple of years, and with our degrees finished, we 
        could finally and gladly reveal our pride; the KLEAN filtration system, aka the KFS to the world.      
      </p>
